This project proposes an algorithm to analyze DNA-binding proteins (DBPs) and locate their target sites within the genome. It hypothesizes that certain nucleotide sequences in DNA act as "pointers" to guide the binding process. The tool utilizes a sliding window approach to identify potential "pointer" sequences.

## üß¨ Features

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**:
  - Built with **JavaFX**, the GUI allows users to interact with the tool easily, select input files, and choose the algorithm for analysis.
- **Biological Analysis**:
  - Detects patterns and frequencies in DNA sequences, comparing biological data with shuffled data to uncover biological signals.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Algorithms Details

### Algorithms Overview
This project includes several algorithms designed to identify potential DNA-binding site pointers by analyzing the distribution and occurrence of nucleotide sequences. Below is a brief description of each algorithm:

1. **Segmented DNA Analysis**: This algorithm divides the DNA sequence into smaller segments around the binding site. It focuses on the segment before the binding site (1/32 segment) and uses a sliding window approach to find words that appear more frequently in this segment. Words with less frequent reverse complements are considered potential pointers.

2. **Word Occurrences DNA Analysis**: This algorithm extracts words from both the upstream and downstream regions of the binding site and compares their frequencies. It identifies words that are more frequent in the downstream region (forward direction) and less frequent in the upstream region (reverse complement), which may point to potential binding sites.

3. **Segmented Word Distribution Analysis**: The DNA sequence is divided into segments, and a sliding window is used to identify unique word sequences. The algorithm checks if the frequency distribution forms an ascending pattern before the binding site and a descending pattern afterward, identifying potential pointers based on this distribution.

4. **Potential PWM Pointers**: This algorithm uses a Position Frequency Matrix (PFM) to construct a Position Weight Matrix (PWM) for the DNA sequence. It then calculates the score for each window using the PWM and identifies potential pointers if the score is close to the maximum and if occurrences are greater downstream than upstream.

## üõ†Ô∏è Dependencies

The tool is built using **Java** for the GUI (**JavaFX**) and the core algorithm. The following biological databases were used:

- **JASPAR CORE Database**: Contains transcription factor binding sites.
- **NCBI GRCh38.p14 Primary Assembly Dataset**: A reference genome dataset used for analysis.

### Preprocessing:
- DNA sequence files and binding site data files should be preprocessed. (Note: preprocessing is done outside of this repository using C++ and Python, and is **not** included here.)

### Libraries/Frameworks:
- **JavaFX**: For GUI development.
- **Custom Algorithms**: Implemented in Java.
